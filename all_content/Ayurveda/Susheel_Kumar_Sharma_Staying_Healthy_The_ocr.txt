CHAPTER 15

Staying Healthy:
The Ayurvedic Way

Susheel Kumar Sharma

Abstract

This paper argues for the need and relevance of the ancient medical
system, Ayurveda, in the contemporary world especially during the
pandemic COVID-19. The health system of the yore takes care of the
identification of an illness, the causes of illness, the methodology to
restore health and the methods of checking the spread and recurrence of
an illness by adopting affordable means. Ayurveda, not only takes care of
the physical, psychological, moral and spiritual being of a person (the four
parameters of health enunciated by WHO) but also takes care of the social
and the environmental world around him, besides paying attention to the
supreme powers that remain invisible to the physical eyes. Largely by
tegimenting one’s dietary habits and life-style the system charts the path of
keeping one healthy. Ayurveda being affordable, sustainable and
environment friendly gratifies and empowers all and it may be practiced
independent of any Institutional (religious, social and medical)
tegimentation. This system is fit to be adopted by all not only during the
normal days but also during the crisis-torn period of COVID-19. The
paper also argues that the continuation of Macaulay’s system of education
is responsible for the modern Indians’ ignorance and poor understanding
and appreciation of this system. The paper also focuses on the features like
causes and cures of diseases in Ayurveda, Ayurvedic principles like
Samanya Vishesha Siddhanta, Panch Mahabhoota Siddhanta, Tridosha
Siddhanta, Dinacharya and Ritucharya, food and spices in Ayurveda, the
Principles of Health Promotion, and handling of Epidemics in Ayurveda.

Introduction

This paper is an intervention in the controversy between an article
(Ghosal and Wang) which appeared in The New York Times on April
17, 2020 and its rebuttal (Aywsh) by the Indian Government after


--- Page 7 ---
STAYING HEALTHY: THE AYURVEDIC WAY | 287

which the article has been blocked from further dissemination
though it is available on other websites. I find the article to be one of
many such tirades against India in the Western press and the rebuttal
very mild. Aniruddha Ghosal and Yanan Wang’s article smacks of
haughtiness and pride verging on belligerence out to debunk
traditional societies and wisdom by using choicest epithets generally
used by left wingers. The authors try to prove WHO reports and
protocols as if suggested by omniscient gods and the traditional
believers as fools without realising that science works with the
principle of hit and try. In the Western media India bashing is quite
common and they keep on spreading baseless canards because of
several reasons. Maria Wirth mentions two reasons for this malicious
attitude of the Western press: “... [The West] saw themselves as
superior and others not quite as human.” (mariawirthblog) She
mentions Christianity as the root of this attitude. In another article
of hers she says some Indians too use the western media to spread
“pure poison, [and carry out] vicious and dangerous [propaganda].”
All this takes place because “Hindus are often too naive to realize
what mind- set the dogmatic religions foster. ... Nobody needs to
be worried about a nation where the Hindu roots are fostered.”
(mariawirthblog) The report that “There is a nexus between India’s
vanguard secularists and anti-Indian forces in Washington and
Islamabad,” (Rao and Elst) in another case is valid in this case too.
There are some other such reports as well. For example, “Why is the
western media biased about India?” (indiaincgroup.com) and “BBC
to New York Times — Why Indian governments have always been
warty of foreign press” (theprint.in). Western media (dw.com) apart,
even most of the Indians have lost touch with their wisdom because
of a particular kind of attitude inculcated in the Indian modern
education system developed by Macaulay and fostered by Indian
leadership even during the post-colonial times. Let us first have a
look at Macaulayan agenda of education for a better understanding
of the issue.

Through his enlightenment project Macaulay was “attempting to
raise up a large class of enlightened natives. [He further hoped] that,
twenty years hence, there will be hundreds, nay thousands, of natives
familiar with the best models of composition, and well acquainted
with Western science. Among them some persons will be found who
will have the inclination and the ability to exhibit European
knowledge in the vernacular dialects.” (columbia.edu) These natives


--- Page 8 ---

were not only to be the men of science but also “a class [of]
interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern, — a class
of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in tastes, in
opinions, in morals and in intellect.” (columbia.edu) Macaulay’s
supposition was that Indians (in 1835, the year the Minutes appeared)
were ignorant of science because he was perhaps surrounded by a
group of persons who either were not familiar with Indian wisdom
ot were out to decry it for some reason. Macaulay writes: “I have
never found one among them who could deny that a single shelf of a
good European library was worth the whole native literature of India
and Arabia. The intrinsic superiority of the Western literature is
indeed fully admitted by those members of the committee who
support the oriental plan of education.” (columbia.edu) He switches
his arguments from history to literature, from literature to
philosophy, from philosophy to utilitarianism and to science so
frequently that his comments are nothing but sweeping
generalizations to debunk Indian knowledge and trash Indian
knowledge-systems. Macaulay’s plan had a covert agenda too. It is
revealed in his letter dated October12, 1836 to his father Zachary
Macaulay:

Our English schools are flourishing wonderfully. ... The effect of
this education on the Hindoos is prodigious. No Hindoo who has
received an English education ever continues to be sincerely attached
to his religion. Some continue to profess it as a matter of policy. But
many profess themselves pure Deists, and some embrace Christianity.
The case with Mahometans is very different. The best-educated
Mahometan often continues to be a Mahometan still. The reason is
plain. The Hindoo religion is so extravagantly absurd that it is
impossible to teach a boy astronomy, geography, natural history,
without completely destroying the hold which that religion has on
his mind. But the Mahometan religion belongs to a better family. It
has very much in common with Christianity; and even where it is
most absurd, it is reasonable when compared with Hindooism. It is
my firm belief that, if our plans of education are followed up, there
will not be a single idolater among the respectable classes in Bengal
thirty years hence. And this will be effected without any efforts to
proselytise, without the smallest interference with religious liberty,
merely by the natural operation of knowledge and reflection [sic]. I
heartily rejoice in this prospect .... (Irevelyan, 454-56)

In this context it is very easy to understand as to why Macaulay
conceitedly tries to prove the superiority of English over Sanskrit and
Arabic and replace the latter with the former. The sum that had been
earmarked by the East India Company “for the revival and
promotion of literature, and the encouragement of the learned
natives of India, and for the introduction and promotion of a
knowledge of the sciences among the inhabitants of the British
territories” (columbia.edu) was only the pretext for a larger ensnaring
design that Macaulay prepared. However, all the tall claims of
“intrinsic superiority and advancement” fell flat in the wake of the
COVID -19. There are some bold “enlightened interpreters” who
instead of displaying their “ability to exhibit European knowledge in
the vernacular dialects” have assumed the role of Macaulay and
they keep on trying to shame India by donning the role of the
trumpeters of the former colonial masters.

During the contingent situation of the pandemic, COVID-19,
which has paralysed the entire world, alternatives are being
explored everywhere to prepare counter-strategies to meet the crisis.
The news ' of various conspiracy theories, corrupt Big Pharma and
the elite and global totalitarianism and slavery has further
complicated the situation and the issue. Alternative and reliable
models for health preservation need to be looked for urgently and
necessarily. In such a context a time-tested and knowledge-based
system like Ayurveda is the best possible model. The paper argues
for the adoption of a good and readily existing solution like
Ayurveda. A Health System is supposed to take care of the following
issues: a) the identification of an illness b) the causes of some
particular person’s suffering from some illness? c) the methodology
to bring an ill body to its normal state and d) the methods for
checking its spread and recurrence by adopting affordable means.
Ayurveda is one such system that has logical answers to all these
issues. Though it is a full-fledged science that needs to be learned
rigorously, only some glimpses of it are being presented here with a
view to atouse one’s curiosity to read further and to prove that
Ayurveda fully empowers an individual and reduces his dependence
on the government and other outer agencies. It is eclectic in nature as
rather than promoting any sort regimentation by the elites it
promotes empowering of the individuals by encouraging them to
manage theit physical, psychological and spiritual selves by
maintaining a healthy social and environmental relationship.

The Health Science: Ayurveda

The Hindus consider a human being to be as (un)important creature
and part of the entire Consciousness as any other creature is and
therefore, they do not give him any special place in Hindu
Cosmology/ world view, unlike the Christian practice. Despite this
they developed a science for curing the body of physical and mental
diseases and physical deformities by administering medicines and
performing operations” because the Hindus attach the same value to
a living human body as a scientist attaches to his equipments. The
study/ science of human body and its relation with entire cosmology
is popularly known as Ayurveda.” The word Ayurveda* literally
means: “the text/science that bestows knowledge about life.”
Amongst several texts on the subject, three viz. Charak Samhita,
Sushruta Samhita and Vagbhata’s Ashtang, Hridaya are recognised as the
Great trio (Brihatrayi). The word Ayurveda consists of two
morphemes viz. ayw and veda. According to Charak Sambita (Sutra
Sthana 1:42) the conjunction of body (Shareera), sense organs
(Indriya), mind (Satva) and soul (Atma) is called life (Ayz); the word
‘Veda’ means knowledge. Hence, Ayurveda means the knowledge of
the union of body, sense organs, mind and soul. Ayurveda is
regarded as a sub- veda (Upaveda) of Atharva Veda. It is also called the
Panchama Veda (the 5th Veda) and is considered to be the Nectar

of Nature (@adeisyarry ayurvedo-amritanam). The six basic principles
of this Veda (compendium of knowledge) are: the knowledge of
similarity (samanya), dissimilarity (wvishesha), property (guna),
substance (dravya), action (karma) and inherence (samvaya). It is
claimed that by following the above tenets the highest well-being and
non-perishable life span can be obtained. (Charak Samhita, Sutra
Sthana\: 27-29)* The encyclopaedic Charak Samhita defines Ayurveda
as follows: something that bestows the knowledge about life (ayz) is
ayutveda (Charak Sambita, Sutra Sthana 30:23).' Another place it is
defined as the treatise which describes Hita ayu (favourable to life),
Abita ayu (adverse to life), Sukh ayu (healthy life) and dukh ayu
(diseased life-state) (Charak Samhita, Sutra Sthana 1:41).° Ayurveda,
therefore, deals with good, bad, blissful and sorrowful life and what is
wholesome and unwholesome for it, longevity and about what ayu
(life) is in itself. Ayurveda consists of the following eight branches of
knowledge: General Medicine (Kayachikitsa), Diseases of eye, ear, nose
and throat (Shalakya), Surgery (Shalyatantra), ‘Toxicology
(Agadatantra/ Visha Chikitsa), Paranormal Science / Psychotherapy


--- Page 11 ---
STAYING HEALTHY: THE AYURVEDIC WAY | 291

(Bhoot vidya), Obstetrics, Gynaecology & Paediatrics (Kaumarbhritya),
Rejuvenation/ Anti-ageing treatment (Rasayana) and Reproductive
sciences or sexual vitality (Vajikarana). (Charak Samhita, Sutra Sthana
30: 28). This science of life enunciates principles to treat body as a
whole and concentrates on a personalised approach to every
individual."

Charak Samhita comprises 120 chapters categorized into eight
sections, or Shana. They are: Sutra Sthana (Fundamental Principles, 30
chapters) Nedana Sthana (Primary Causes and Diagnosis, 8 chapters),
Vimana Sthana (Quantification and Inference, 8 chapters), Sharira
Sthana (Holistic Human Being, 8 chapters), Indriya Sthana (Lifespan of
Patients, 12 chapters), Chikitsa Sthana (Management of Various
Diseases, 30 chapters), Ka/pa Sthana (Pharmacology, 12 chapters)
and Szddhi Sthana (Modes of ‘Therapeutic Administration, 12
chapters). The text is written partly in the form of verses (sh/oka) and
partly in prose. In the last chapter of the Szddbi Sthana (12: 52), it is
mentioned that there are 12000 verses in the text. However, only
8419 verses and 1111 prose paragraphs are available now. Charak
Samhita contains many remarks in the fields of human anatomy,
embryology, physiology, pharmacology, blood circulation and
diseases like diabetes, tuberculosis, heart disease, etc which are held in
reverence even today. The book also describes medicinal qualities and
functions of more than a million herbal plants. He has emphasized
the outcome of diet and activity on mind and body. He has proved
the correlation of spirituality and physical health and has contributed
greatly to the diagnostic and curative sciences. Charka’s principles,
diagnoses, and cures retain their potency and truth even after a
couple of millennia.

The origin of surgery is as old as the warfare. The surgical
science, known as Shalyatantra, was quite well developed in India.
Sushruta is widely regarded as the father of Indian surgery. His work
Sushruta Samhita is known for anatomical knowledge and surgical
procedural descriptions. The Sashruta Samhita is in two parts, the first,
called Purva- tantra, is in five sections viz. Sutra Sthana (Introduction
to Medical Science Especially Surgery, Medical Education and
Training, Theory of Therapeutic Substances and Dietetics, 46
chapters), Nidan Sthana (Pathology and Diagnosis, 16 chapters),
Shareer Sthana (Anatomy and Physiology, 10 chapters), Chikistha
Sthana (Therapeutics in Various Diseases, 40 chapters) and Ka/pa
Sthana (Pharmacology, 8 chapters). The second called Ustara-tantra


--- Page 12 ---
292 | IMPACT OF PANDEMIC ON SOCIETY, CULTURE AND EDUCATION

consists of 66 chapters on different branches of medical science viz.
Shalakayatantra (Etiology, Diagnosis, Prognosis, Prevention and
Treatment of Diseases in and around the Head, 26 chapters),
Kaumaryabhritya (Paediatrics, 13 chapters), Kayachikitsa (General
Medicine, 21 chapters), Bhutvidya (Super-Natural Aetiology, 3
chapters) and Tantrayukh (Diagnosis Devices 4 chapters). Some of
the principles for study and the theory and practice as suggested by
Sushruta are valid even today. For example, for the study of anatomy,
he suggested dissection of a dead body; for experimental teachings
he suggested incision on vegetables such as watermelon and
cucumber and probing on worm-eaten woods. The book deals with
the principles of traction, manipulation, apposition, stabilization and
postoperative physiotherapy to manage orthopaedic dislocations and
fractures. Sushruta discusses measures to induce growth of lost hair
and removal of unwanted hair. Sushruta is also acknowledged as the
first dental anatomist of the world and he was familiar with
techniques of anaesthesia and recovery. He also invented several
surgical instruments. Rhinoplasty, inoculation against small pox etc
were practiced in India even as late as the 18th Century AD, as shown
by Dharampal in his book entitled Indian Science and Technology in the
Eighteenth Century. The technique for Rhinoplasty as suggested by
Sushruta is still being used successfully to perform operations.

The third scholar of classical Ayurveda, Vagbhata, a Buddhist, is
believed to have lived in Sindh around the sixth century. From among
the several books ascribed to him the Ashtangsangraha'' and the
Ashtanghridayasamhita’* are most important. Ashtangsangraha consists of
a total of 150 chapters which are classified as: Sutra Sthana (40
chapters), Nidana Sthana (16 chapters), Shareera Sthana (12 chapters),
Chikitsa Sthana (24 chapters), Kalpa Sthana (08 chapters) and
Khila/ Uttara (50 chapters). Ashtanghridayasambita consists of a total
of 120 chapters which are classified as: Sara Sthana (30 chapters)
Nidana Sthana (16 chapters), Shareera Sthana (06 chapters), Chikitsa
Sthana (22 chapters), Kalpa Sthana (06 chapters), and Khila/ Uttara (40
chapters). There are a few more important books on the subject like
Bhava Prakash Samhita, Bhela Samhita, Harit Samhita, Kashyap Samhita,
Madhava Nidanam and Sharngadhbara Samhita.

World Health Organization on Health

World Health Organization (WHO) considers “Health ... [to be] a
resource for everyday life, not the objective of living; it is a positive
concept, emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as
physical capacities.” '* WHO defines health as “a state of complete
physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of
disease or infirmity”’'* The definition was agreed upon by 61
signatories in 7946. It has been challenged on several counts’? but it
has not yet been amended" though the process of changing it is on.

It is clear from the existing definition that a “complete well-
being” is the objective of WHO; however, the word “complete” in it
has drawn flakes from the stakeholders as this indicates a sort of
perfection which is not achievable by any human being. Moreover,
some parts of the definition are tangible while others are not. Again,
a “social well-being” cannot be defined without any reference to
ethical values. So, there is an ample scope of variation in terms of a
community’s attitude, feelings, understanding and acceptance. In
otder to implement this definition as a working model further
classifications and quantifications are needed. Another objection to
the WHO’s accepted definition is that it does not make a difference
between the animal and the human needs and it is, therefore, equally
applicable to the animals. It strengthens Schumacher’s charge that the
animal model of humanity has grown popular in science. Therefore,
there is a need to give science/ health a human angle. Schumacher
(Guide 25-28), in a different context, notes that within the humanities
the distinction between consciousness and _ self-consciousness is
seldom drawn. Taking appropriate cues from Buddhism he suggests
the following four equations to underline the difference between
animals and human beings:

“Mineral” = m “Plant” = m + x “Animal” = m + x +y

“Human” =mt+xt+ytz,

where m= inanimate matter, x= life-force, y= consciousness and
z= self- awareness. While m is real, the other three factors (x, y
and z) experienced by each individual represent ontological
discontinuities. WHO has made some efforts to make its definition
more human-centric in practice. For example, while chalking out
plans for ‘Global Strategy for Health for All by the Year 2000’,
Desh Bandhu Bisht'® presented a short report, based on


--- Page 14 ---
294 | IMPACT OF PANDEMIC ON SOCIETY, CULTURE AND EDUCATION

Schumacher’s arguments, entitled “Spiritual Dimensions of
Health”"’. It was accepted by the Executive Board of the WHO (in
the 73rd session, Agenda Item 11, EB, R3, Seventh meeting,
EB73/SR/7 dated 16 January 1984) and subsequently recommended
to the 37" World Health Assembly to “note the Boatd’s conclusions.”
The reflection paper on the theme also tried to define the term
“spirituality” in ethical and secular terms by culling out the common
idea from the meanings in four different dictionaries, two each in
English and French: Spirituality is “a phenomenon that is not
material in nature but belongs to the realm of ideas that have arisen
in the minds of human beings, particularly ennobling ideas.””” The
definition was slightly expanded in the 37" World Health Assembly
by adding “beliefs, values and ethics” to this definition: “spiritual
dimension ... [implies] a phenomenon that is not material in nature
but belongs to the realm of ideas, beliefs, values and ethics that have
arisen in the minds and conscience of human beings, particularly
ennobling ideas.”*' Having conceded that “the spiritual dimension
plays a great role in motivating people’s achievements in all aspects of
life’ WHO has called upon the Member States to consider a
spiritual dimension (as defined in the WHO resolution [see supra] in
accordance with their own social and cultural patterns” in their
Health for All” strategies. Further, the Executive Board of WHO
on the recommendation of the special group has proposed the
following amendment in the definition of health: “Health is a
dynamic state of complete physical, mental, spiritual and social well-
being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”” but so far
neither the definition of health nor the preamble to WHO's
constitution has been amended to accommodate the proposal.
However, with the inclusion of spiritual health within WHO’s
purview, a number of other significant organizations have also
attended to the spiritual needs and incorporated reference to it in
their key documents. For example, the action plan “Agenda 21” of
the United Nations recognizes the right of individuals to “healthy
physical, mental, and spiritual development”. This has led to some
research in this direction. For example, it has been reported by
Ahmad Ghaderi and others in their “Explanatory definition of the
concept of spiritual health: a qualitative study in Iran”
(ncbi.nlm.nih.gov):

A large number of systematic reviews showed that spiritual
health can contribute to positive health outcomes (17). Heidari ef al.


--- Page 15 ---
STAYING HEALTHY: THE AYURVEDIC WAY | 295

revealed that spiritual health improves physical well-being and quality
of life (18). Research conducted on patients with asymptomatic heart
failure in 2009 indicated that spiritual health is positively related to
better mental health (19). Rahnama ef a/ also showed that spiritual
health prevents the emergence of depression and anxiety in patients
with spinal cord injury (20). This is in agreement with the results of
the present study that illustrated the positive effect of spiritual health
on physical, mental and social health. (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)

Health in Ayurveda: Principles and Practice

The Sanskrit word for health, swastha, has two morphemes: (1) swa=
mine (my own self/soul/pran/jivatma) and (ii) stha= to be located.
According to derivational etymology, Swastha is defined as “staying in
one’s self (or own natural state) with equanimity””’. It is explained as:
one who stays in its specified place is swastha. As life (ayu) is
a conglomeration of the four interdependent components namely,
the body (Shareera), the sensory and motor faculties (Ivdriya), the
mind (Sava), and the soul (Atma) (Charak Samhita, Sutra Sthana 1:42)”, a
perfect healthy life necessitates a wellness of all the four and an
absolute complementary support of all of them. The Ayurvedic
concept of health, therefore, encompasses the physical, mental,
sensory and spiritual domains. In Ayurveda a healthy human being
has been defined as one who has congruent and_ balanced
musculature, compactness of the body and strong sensory and motor
units, one who withstands and survives the onslaughts of illness, one
who is able to endure hunger and thirst, one who successfully braves
vatiance of atmospheric temperature (high temperature of the sun
and cold weather), one who can perform exercises (daily chores)
comfortably and one who is able to digest and assimilate food easily.
(Charak, Samhita, Sutra Sthana 2118-19)”

The three roots of a human body”, according to Sushruta Samhita,
ate: dosha (Vataadi Tridosha’'), dhatu (Rasadi Sapta Dhatu*) and mala
(trimala”); as the life of a tree depends on the strength of its roots, in
the same way the origin, the maintenance and the destruction of a
human body depends on these three building blocks. Sushruta Samhita
details the definition of health in keeping with the spirit of the word,
swastha and the above three elements: one who has the doshas (primary
life force) in equilibrium, the ag (digestive fire) in a balanced state,
well-formed dhatus (tissues), proper physiological functions for
elimination of malas (excretions etc.) and well-functioning bodily


--- Page 16 ---
296 | IMPACT OF PANDEMIC ON SOCIETY, CULTURE AND EDUCATION

processes, and whose sensory and motor organs, mana (mind), atma
(soul) and indriya (senses) have enough balance to keep one in a
pleasant state is called a healthy person or Swastha.* When it is
restricted to physical body/health of an individual it is known by the
following aspects: a proper nourishment, a proper strength, a desire
and appetite for an intake of food, a proper digestion of food
ingested at proper time, a sleep at proper time, an absence of
pathological or dreadful dreams, a feeling of freshness after waking
up in the morning, a proper evacuation of faeces, urine, and flatus at
the proper time, a proper functioning of mental faculties,
intelligence and senses in all respects and an absence of any kind of
pain.

Ayurveda” emphasizes the balance of a body, mind and soul to
achieve an anatomical, physiological, mental and spiritual well-being,
Ayurveda aims at maintaining a healthy person’s health (by preventing
illness), healing the sick by managing dysfunctions of the body and
curing diseases (of mind, body or both) that manifest in a person,
protecting health, prolonging and preserving life: “svasthasya svasthya
rakshanam, aturasya vikara prashamanam” (Charak Samhita, Sutra Sthana
30: 26).°° It may be noted here that the word used in the verse cited
above is cure (= shaman) and not suppress (= daman). Ayurveda
considers human body to be the storehouse of diseases.°’” Ayurveda
does not act on the principle of killing bacteria or virus but on the
one that eliminates foreign material that gives birth to them or
attracts them to the body by using Sodbana (detoxification techniques)
followed by the Panchkarma.* Remaining healthy is given more
importance in Ayurveda while managing diseases is given the
second priority. Health is not only the prerequisite but also the
objective of a person for fulfilling three basic desires (Eshanas)” of
human beings viz. longevity, wealth (or materialistic comforts), and a
blissful afterlife (after death) and for achieving all the four major goals
(four Purusharthas: Dharma, Artha, Kama, andMoksha) of a human life."*

Diseases: Causes & Cures in Ayurveda

Technically speaking, absence of health is sickness and a person who
is not healthy is sick (rege). On the basis of the Sushruta’s definition
cited earlier (Sushruta Samhita, Sutra Sthana 15:10) a person whose doshas
are not in equilibrium, the digestive fire is not in a balanced state and
the dhatus (tissues) and malas (wastes) are not working in a normal
way; the sensory and motor organs and mind, atma are not in a


--- Page 17 ---
STAYING HEALTHY: THE AYURVEDIC WAY | 297

pleasant state is called sick (aswastha). “Roga’, the Sanskrit word for a

a> ce

“disease” has many synonyms” like “vyadh?’, “atanka’, “yakshma’,
“wara’, and “vikarad’. Similarly, “nidan”, the Sanskrit word for word
for a “diagnosis/ prognostic”, has many synonyms like “Hetu, nimitta,
ayatana, karta, karana, pratyaya and samutthana’”’. (Charak Samhita,
Nidana Sthana 1:3) Doing away with the causes that lead to a disease in
such a manner that they do not reappear or recut is called prognosis/
treatment. (Sushruta Samhita, Uttaratantra 1: 25)” Nidana is of three
types: unsuitable contact of sense organs with their objects
(Asatmyendriyarthasamyoga), intellectual errors or knowingly engaging
in harmful activities (Pragyaparadha), and seasonal, temporal factors
(Kala). (Charak Samhita, Nidana Sthana 1:3, op. cit.)

Ayurveda classifies diseases into three categories on the basis of
their sources/ places of appearance viz. physical, mental and
environmental.” For example, conditions like boils, physical cuts,
fractures, intestinal ailments and cough are physical ailments;
diseases like narcissistic personality disorder, claustrophobia and
high blood pressure are psychosomatic as they have their source in
mind; and epidemics like plague, yellow fever, meningitis, a pandemic
like COVID-19 and the diseases caused by famine or flood are
environmental as they have their genesis in the environment. Physical
ailments (Nia/ endogenous) are caused by the vitiation of body
doshas (vata, pitta and kapha). They are mainly of three types, viz.
Agneya (pitta dosha dominant diseases), Saumya (kapha dosha dominant
diseases), Vayavya (vata dosha dominant diseases).*” They are grouped
as Somatic diseases. The simplest formula for the recovery of a
patient suffering from the vitiated doshas (humours) is to restore the
equilibrium of the doshas.

Mental/ psychological (Manasa) ailments are caused by a conflict
between not getting the desired things and getting non-desired things.
Sattav (associated with the quality of balance, harmony, goodness,
purity), Rajas (associated with the quality of passion, desire and
activity) and Tamas (associated with quality of imbalance, disorder,
anxiety, impure, and lethargy) are considered to be the bio-chemical
forces affecting the state of the mind. These (psychic) diseases are of
two types viz. Rajas dosha dominant and Tamas dosha dominant
diseases. (Charak Samhita, Nidana Sthana 1:4) Those who are not able
to control their rajas and tamas (psychological doshas) cannot attain
salvation.” For a patient’s recovery” from this type of ailments it is
suggested that the patient has to act wise and ponder over carefully to


--- Page 18 ---
298 | IMPACT OF PANDEMIC ON SOCIETY, CULTURE AND EDUCATION

know as to what is (un)beneficial and has to discard the
unwholesome regimens. The patient should also, try to acquire
knowledge about self (atman), place (desha), time (Kala), strength (ba/a)
and potential/capacity (shakti). He should regulate his conduct related
to virtue (dharma), wealth (artha) and desire (kama) besides serving the
wise (who are familiar with the psychological diseases) and following
their instructions.

Envitonmental/ exogenous ailments (Agantuja) refer to the
injuries caused by invisible organisms/ factors (bhuta; bacteria/ virus
eft) from outside like poisonous substances, wind, fire and trauma.
These diseases are normally averted by three types of strength/
power/ immunities viz. hereditary, since birth (Sabaja), seasonal or
periodic (kalga), and acquired (ywktkrita) which are invigorated by
taking proper food (Asara), proper sleep (dra) and observance of
celibacy/control of senses (brambacharya).

According to Ayurveda miseries ate caused because of the
impairment of intellect (dba), controlling power (dhrit) and memory
(smriti ot tecalling power), ageing/advent of maturity and
unwholesome contact with objects of senses and deeds. (Charak
Samhita, Sharira Sthana 1: 98)."° Because of the impairment of the
intellectual prowess a person starts indulging in inauspicious/
undesirable deeds. These causes have further been reduced to three
viz. time, external environmental factors and one’s ability to respond
to one’s external environment. (Charak Sambita, Sutra Sthana 11: 38 —
44; Shareera Sthana 2: 40)” Of these the last one is the most important
one. Unlike the western system of identifying an enemy outside in the
form of a bacteria or a virus Ayurveda finds the cause of the disease
largely within the person. Ayurveda holds the unwholesome union
[excessive utilisation (4#yoga), non-utilisation (ayoga) and wrong
utilisation (mithyayoga) | of the sense organs
(asatmyaindriyarthsamyoga), the intellectual defects/ misdoings
(prajnaparadha) and adaptability to the seasonal effects (kala parinam) as
the three causes of diseases.”’ Thus, a disease is largely the result of
an individual’s misdoings and weaknesses. On the other hand, a
proper utilization and a wholesome union (Samyoga) of the sense
organs, the actions and the time are beneficial for the maintenance of
health. Thus, the body and the mind are the abodes of diseases as
well as health. Proper body-mind interaction is the cause for
happiness.” It is, therefore, expected that an individual has to pay


--- Page 19 ---
STAYING HEALTHY: THE AYURVEDIC WAY | 299

utmost attention to his body- mind interaction in order to stay
healthy.

If an individual himself is the cause of his disease and he alone
has to manage it; this proposition should not lead one to conclude
that there is no need/role of a doctor in Ayurveda. Had that been the
case there would not have been an occasion for their classification
into three categories” of the physicians (bhishaj/) viz. pseudo
physicians/ impostors  (bhishakchadmacarah),  feigned/pretender
physicians (séddhasadhit), and the genuine physicians with essential
qualities (vaidya guna yukta / jivitabhisara). The bottom-line in
Ayurveda is: the unwholesome/sinful acts (pragyaparadba)”? vitiate
the doshas and an imbalance in the doshas triggers an ailment. The
identification of the vitiated humour and the strategy to pacify it,
therefore, is a technical task more so, because unlike the practice in
the allopathic system, Ayurveda does not suggest a ready- made and
standard protocol to follow in a particular ailment. Ayurveda generally
suggests treatments according to the types of the diseases. For
example, administering medicines or an operation is good for the first
type (physical) of diseases, chanting of certain mantras has been
suggested for the second type (mental) and general cleanliness and
social control have been suggested for the third type (environmental).
Similarly, it has been suggested that the physical ailments are pacified
by adopting the remedial measures of the divine and rational
qualities while the manas dosha can be treated with general and specific
knowledge, temperance, memory and concentration. (Charak Samhita,
Sutra Sthana 1:58)."* Thus, it is clear that in absence of a prescribed
regimented path a physician, according to his perception, experience
and knowledge, has to chart the path for the equilibrium of the doshas
leading to the patient’s recovery from the disease.

Ayurveda mentions three kinds of treatment modalities” and
three kinds of cleansing processes.” The three treatment modalities
are: a) Divine or spiritual or non-material therapy (Dazvavyapashraya)
which includes mantra chanting, taking medicines, wearing gems,
auspicious offerings, oblations, gifts, offerings to sacred fire, sticking
to the spiritual rules, atonement, fasting, chanting of the auspicious
hymns (mantras), obeisance to the seniors and the gods, pilgrimages
etc. b) Therapy based on reasoning (ywktivyapashraya) which includes
proper regimen of dietetic and life-style, medicine planning,
panch karma and c) psychotherapy (satwavajaya; dependant on sattwa)
which includes a withdrawal of mind from harmful objects (Rajasic


--- Page 20 ---
300 | IMPACT OF PANDEMIC ON SOCIETY, CULTURE AND EDUCATION

and Tamasic symptoms). Cleansing is desirable in all the three types of
diseases to pacify the vitiated doshas of the body. It has three types: a)
Internal cleansing (Antahaparimarjana) which introduces drugs inside
body for the treatment of diseases caused by an improper diet etc.,
b) External cleansing (Bahiparimarjana) which is done over the skin
by the application of massage, sudation, unction, affusion, applying
external pressure and kneading over affected body part externally and
c) Surgical procedures (Shastrapranidana) that include excision,
incision, puncturing, rupturing, scraping, uprooting, rubbing
superficially with rough surface, suturing, probing, application of
alkalis and leeches.

It is clearly suggested that a person who wishes to stay healthy
should take a wholesome diet, move cautiously, make donations,
observe equality, remain truthful, and respect venerable people. One
should have a good behaviour and a forbearing attitude besides
remaining unattached to the sensual pleasures. One who is endowed
with such an intellect, speech and (positive) actions which yield good
results, who has a submissive mind, clear understanding, and
knowledge, and who does penance and makes continued efforts in
yoga, does not fall victim to diseases. (Charak Samhita, Shareera Sthana
2: 46-47)”

It is clear from the above that Ayurveda encourages the
maintenance of health through a close attention to balance in one’s
life, right thinking, lifestyle and the use of herbs. Knowledge of
Ayurveda enables one to understand how to create this balance of
body, mind and consciousness according to one’s own individual
constitution and how to make lifestyle changes to bring about and
maintain this balance.

Ayurveda: The Principles

The modern medical system, in the typical occidental approach of
looking for the outside/ external forces, considers some bacteria
and/ ot virus responsible for most of the diseases and therefore
insists on destroying them. On the other hand, Ayurveda, in the
typical oriental manner, looks within a person to locate the source of
a disease within the body. In the Indian/Oriental approach the enemy
may keep on dwelling outside if the inside is protected enough.
Therefore, Ayurveda, instead of concentrating on killing a bacteria/
virus, tries to consolidate the inner strength. So, in Ayurveda it is not
a constant struggle between good and bad forces but there is an


--- Page 21 ---
STAYING HEALTHY: THE AYURVEDIC WAY | 301

effort to balance for a peaceful coexistence. Ayurveda works mainly
on the following three principles:

Principle 1: Principle of Similarity & Dissimilarity (Samanya
Vishesha Siddhanta)

The principle of a dravya (substance) that brings about union or
increase in the dravya’s quality or quantity is called “samanya’” (similar)
and the principle (of a dravya) that brings about non-union or
decrease in a dravya’s quality or quantity is called “vishesha’
(dissimilar/ special)”. (Charak Samhita, Sutra Sthana 1:44-45)

Principle 2: Principle of Five Fundamental Elements (Panch

Mahabhoota Siddhanta)

Each and every cell, organ, organ systems and in general every
Dravya (substance/ human body) in the universe consists of the
following five proto elements (Pancha Mahabhoota) that are in different
proportion in each substance —

« Akasha (space proto element)
¢  Vaayu (air proto element)
« Agni (fire proto element)
¢ Jal (water proto element)

« Prithvi (earth proto element)

Bhoota Associated |Associated Sense| Perception mode
(Element) Sense Organ
Akash (Space) Sound Ear Heard
Vayu (Air) Touch Skin Heard, Felt
Agni (Fire) Sight/Colour Eye Heard, Felt, Seen
Jal Water) Taste Tongue Heard, Felt, Seen,
Tasted
Prithvi Smell Nose Heard, Felt,Seen,
(Earth) Tasted, Smelled

Ayurveda says the body is made up of tissues (dbatus), waste
products (malas), and doshas” (loosely translated as Energetic Forces).
The five proto elements combined with each other give rise to three
types of doshas (Tridosha)” viz. vata, pitta and kapha. In Ayurveda, dosha is
also known as the governing principle as every living thing in nature
is characterized by the dosha. Dosha means “that which changes/


--- Page 22 ---
302 | IMPACT OF PANDEMIC ON SOCIETY, CULTURE AND EDUCATION

moves.” The doshas are constantly moving in dynamic balance, one
with the others. Therefore, Tridoshas are responsible for assisting in
the creation of various tissues in the body and for the removal of any
unnecessary waste products from the body. Tridoshas influence all
movements, transformations, sensory functions, and many of the
other activities in the human body and mind. In short Doshas
(humours/ energies) ate required for the life to happen. Like the
ancient Greeks, Ayurveda considers a balance in three doshas
responsible for health. All of them have to stay in balance to keep a
body in a healthy and stable state. The following table briefly
summarises the effects of these humours on a human body:

In Ayurveda three words viz. buddhi or intellect, ahamkara ot ego,
and manas or psyche conceptualize the mind. Each of these works
together with separate functions. According to ayurvedic theory,
mental nature is more subtle than physical nature. Sometimes the
body and mind are different types, one compensating for the other,
such as a vata mind in a kapha body. The categories of mental
faculties are linked to #riguna (sattva, rajas and tamas) theory. These
gunas are responsible for the sensitivity of the mind, its capacity to
perceive truth and to act accordingly.

In order to prevent a disease Ayurveda adopts a threefold
approach: monitoring Swasthavrita by following a dinacharya (daily
routine) and rucharya (seasonal routine), monitoring Sadvrita by
following religious rituals and good social practices and taking some
herbal concoctions. For curing a disease, it recommends, cleansing
the bodies of toxins (Sanshodhan), pacifying the deranged or agitated
bodily humours (Sazshaman), monitoring personal (mental and bodily)
acts, and social conduct (Sadvrita), following a regimen of diet
(Pathyahara), and using medicines (Rasayana).

Dinacharya and Ritucharya

Ayurveda emphasizes the prevention of sickness which in terms of
modern science means increasing immunity. It suggests a very simple
formula for achieving this: be aware of oneself and stay in rhythm
and harmony with nature. Ayurveda suggests regulating one’s daily
regimen (Dinacharya) and seasonal regimen (Rtucharya) to align human
bodies with nature’s rhythms to maintain a healthy life on the basis of
the above discussed principles which must be in consonance with the


--- Page 24 ---
304 | IMPACT OF PANDEMIC ON SOCIETY, CULTURE AND EDUCATION

ten principles of dharma outlined in Manusmriti.’ Vagbhata assutes:
“One who always resorts to desirable food and regimen, is
objective, uninterested in sensual affairs, generous, straight
forward, honest, having patience and who values traditional wisdom
will never be affected by diseases.” (Ashtang Hridayam, Sutra Sthana 4:
36). It is also written that “the vigour and complexion (radiance) of
the person following seasonal dietary and lifestyle regimen are
enhanced”, (Charak Samhita, Sutra Sthana 6:3).°° The diet includes
vatious types of food articles which are eatable (ashita), chewable
(khadita), drinkable (pita) and lickable (dha). The food habits (aabar)
and the life-style (vhar) are regulated accordingly. Daily and seasonal
regimens ate respectively dealt with in detail in Matrashiteeya and
Tasyashiteeya chapters of Charak Samhita, (Sutra Sthana, Chapters 5 &
6). Chapters 2 and 3 in Vagbahta’s Ashtang Hriday (Sutra Sthana) are
devoted to daily regime (Diénacharya) and seasonal regimen
(Ritucharya) respectively. Here is an example of a daily regime
(Dinacharya) to keep one healthy on the Ayurvedic principles:

1. Wake up in the wee hours.” A healthy individual should
wake up approximately 80 minutes before sunrise to stay
healthy and soon after should clean all parts of the body
including bowls, teeth, tongue, eyes, nose, throat, etc.

2. Daily exercise (vyayama): One should do some Yoga
exercises (e.g., Sarya Namaskar) ot some other physical
exercises every day. Technically, activities that result in
tiredness are termed vyayama (exercise). Doing exercise
helps one to be capable of daily activities; it increases
digestive power (agi), reduces fat and keeps a body fit.°°
Ayurveda also recommends a person’s qualification and the
time and limit of exercising: One who is strong and eats
unctuous food everyday should use half of one’s energy to
do exercise. The same is to be done in winter season and
autumn. In summer and rainy season, one should use less
than half energy to do exercise.”

3. Apply oil (Abhyanga) daily: Abhyanga means applying oil
all over the body in the direction of the hair follicles (anulom
gati). A daily oil massage reduces premature aging; it keeps
one young, reduces tiredness, pacifies Vata Dosha, brings
clarity to the eyes, nourishes the body, facilitates sound sleep


--- Page 25 ---
STAYING HEALTHY: THE AYURVEDIC WAY | 305

and makes one’s skin healthy. (Ashtang Hridayam, Sutra Sthana
2:8)" It’s good to apply oil to the whole body, but if it is not
possible, one should apply it to one’s face, scalp, into the ears
and feet. It should not be done if a person is suffering from
kapha dosha, indigestion and during the course of Shodhan
therapy. (Ashtang Hridayam, Sutra Sthana 2:9)”

Powder Massage (Uvdartana) everyday: The act of
massaging with fine medicated powders with some friction
on the body in the opposite direction of hair follicles with
high pressure is called as Uvdartana.” It pacifies kaphadosha,
liquefies fat in one’s body, brings about stability in body
parts and also makes the skin lustrous.”

Gandusha (Oil Pulling) and Kavala (Gargling): Oil pulling
(Gandusa) with oil or hot water or Aashaya’” should be done
every day to prevent decay, oral mal-odour and gum
bleeding. This has to be done every day in the morning and
after every meal. Oil-gargling strengthens the jaws and the
voice; it creates a flabby face and induces good taste for
food; if one practises it, one will not suffer from the dryness
of mouth, cracks of lip, diseases of teeth and hoarseness
of voice.’? (Charak Samhita, Sutra Sthana 5: 78-80) Kashaya or
Kavala Graha ot Kavala is a procedure of holding
comparatively small quantity of liquid (oil or medicated or
simple warm water) in the mouth; make it move briskly
inside and spitting out quickly. It removes loss of appetite,
bad taste, dirt and excess salivation from the mouth.

Dress Properly: Keeping in line with Indian traditional
wisdom of dressing” well it is suggested that one should
adopt the following practices to maintain personal hygiene
and make a good appearance in the society: by wearing
clean apparels, using fragrant articles and garlands, wearing
jewels and ornaments, cleansing feet and excretory orifices
regularly, trimming and grooming body hair and_ nails
frequently, using proper footwear and carrying an umbrella
to aversive of calamities. This is required for one’s positive
and productive image building in the society. (Charak
Samhita, Sutra Sthana 5:95-102)

7.

Observe a Regimen of Diet: Unlike modern dietetics,
which is restricted to the concept of calorie consumption,
Ayurveda recommends methods of taking food, its quality
and quantity based upon individual’s capacity to digest (agmi).
Meals should be had at an appropriate time” and in
appropriate quantity”
one’s mouth, washing the feet, hands and face”, only when

, after taking bath and after cleaning

one feels hungry; meals should be the familiar, clean,
healthy (corresponding to the constitution, etc.), oily /
moist, unctuous, hot, pleasant to the mind and easily
digestible. Food-items should be chosen after carefully
considering one’s own constitution, likes and dislikes and
should contain all the six tastes (rasa) with the predominance
of sweet taste; one should have more of pleasant liquid
food. One should practice mindful eating in a calm, quiet
environment, paying due attention to the food and chewing
it properly. This enables better breakdown of food and also
gives time for the digestive enzymes in one’s mouth to do
their work properly. One should have meals without any
bickering, without scolding / abusing the food and without
too much of talk; in the company of the liked persons and
served by clean and faithful persons. One should have one’s
meals after having offered it to the deities, feeding the elders,
guests, children, mentors, after satisfying even the servants,
dependents and pets maintained in the house. (Ashtang
Hridaya Samhita, Sutra Sthana 8: 35-38)" Food substances
which are fatty, sweet, slow and hard and which are not
easily digestible should be consumed at the commencement
of the meal whereas those food items which are opposite in
nature and quality should be had at the end of the meal; and
those which are predominantly sour and salty should be had
in the middle of the meal. (Ashtang Hridaya Samhita, Sutra
Sthana 8: 45)” The food articles like shashtika tice (Oryza
sativum), shali tice (varieties of Oryza sativum rice), green gram
(Vigna radiata), tock-salt, Indian-gooseberry (Phy/anthus
emblica), barley, rain-water, milk, ghee (clarified butter), meat
of the animals living in arid areas and honey can be regularly
consumed for preservation of health. One should take those
food articles daily, which maintain good health besides


--- Page 27 ---
10.

STAYING HEALTHY: THE AYURVEDIC WAY | 307

preventing the onset of diseases. (Charak Samhita, Sutra
Sthana 5: 12-13) The postprandial drinks that are not
harmful to the tissue elements of the body and that are not
incompatible with the food consumed should be taken.
(Ashtang Hridaya Sambita, Sutra Sthana 8: 51)°° One should
regularly have Triphala®' mixed with honey or ghee (clarified
butter) at night for strengthening one’s eye-sight. (Ashtang
Hridaya Samhita, Sutra Sthana 8: 44)” One should not talk or
laugh while eating, or be distracted by other objects”. (Charak
Samhita, Vimana Sthana 1: 25.9) Such food-items as ate re-
heated or are contaminated by grass and hair or by insects
like house flies or very hot/ spicy or salty, consisting mainly
of vegetables or unwholesome pulses should be discarded.
(Ashtang Hridaya Samhita, Sutra Sthana 8: 39)"

Regimen after the Meals: The following needs to be
practiced soon after the meals: mouth gargling, chewing
beetle leaf (fan) and walking about hundred yards. One
should not lecture, travel by vehicles, carry loads, expose to
the sun and retire to bed immediately after the meals.
(Ashtang Hridaya Samhita, Sutra Sthana 8: 54)”

Observe a fast (Lamghana) once a week. Fasting is a
detoxing process which is undertaken for practicing the
“three R’s”: regulating Agni, removing Ama and rebuilding
Ojas. Whatever is capable of reducing the body is known as
lamghana® or reducing therapy (Apartarpana). Fasting is one
among the several types of Lamghana that brings about
lightness in the body. Skipping supper once a week is
recommended as it helps in excretion of the waste from the
body and reduces belching and tiredness (caused without
working); increases lightness; it improves one’s hunger,
thirst, digestion, enthusiasm and psychology and cleans the
sense organs’. (Ashtang Hridaya, Sutra Sthana 14:7)

Use of sauvitanjana & tasanjana: Before retiring to bed
one should daily apply the collyrtum of  sawiranjana
(antimony sulphide), which is beneficial to the eyes; one
should use rasanjana (aqueous extract of Berberis aristata) once
in every fifth or eighth night for cleansing and drainage of
the eyes. (Charak Samhita, Sutra Sthana 5: 15)*


--- Page 28 ---
308 | IMPACT OF PANDEMIC ON SOCIETY, CULTURE AND EDUCATION

11. Sleep (Nidra) Properly: One should take proper sleep
(between 6-8 hours) every night in a clean and pleasant
environment. One should generally avoid sleeping during the
day (except in summer). Proper sleep provides health and
longevity and improves complexion and glow.

12. Stick to Good Conduct (Sadvritta): This world is a
manifestation of God therefore due respect is to be shown
to all the living creatures and non-living things. Happiness
and gaiety should be shared with others for a conductive
social-life. One should exercise a control on one’s sense
organs and live a moral life.

Ritucharya and Health

A few chapters in the various sambitas (of Ayutveda) dedicated to
ritucharya (see supra) discuss the relationship between human health
and seasonal changes caused by the revolution of the earth and tilt of
the earth’s axis. The Hindus calculate time according to the
movements of the earth round the sun (solar calendar) and moon’s
movement atound the earth (lunar calendar) and make use of both
the calendars in their daily lives by synchronizing them. The year
accordingly has two solstices (Ayana) depending on the direction of
the movement of the sun: northern solstice (Ufarayana ot Aadaan
kaal) and southern solstice (Dakshinayana or Visarga kaal). Each
solstice consists of three seasons (Rétus). Thus, six seasons, viz.,
winter (Shishira), spring (Vasanfa), and summer (Grishma) in Summer
Solstice (U#arayan) and monsoon (Varsha), autumn (Sharata), and late
autumn (Hemanta) in Winter Solstice (Dakshinayana) complete one
cycle of the solat year. The Hindus consider human bodies to be a
part of nature. They hold that by harmonizing the human bodies
with seasons better results for human health may be obtained. For
example, during Ustarayana the seasonal change in the Indian
subcontinent is from winter (Shzshira) to spring (Vasanta) and to
summer (Grishma). During this period heat and dryness in the
weather get increased; the sun weakens the streneth of the people
and the cooling quality of the earth. It has an overall debilitating
effect on the environment, to which a human being is also a part. It
increases the dominance of bitter (7&/a), astringent (Kashaya) and
pungent (Katu) Rasa, which increase dryness in the body and reduce
the strength (Bada). Accordingly, one has to plan one’s eating habits
and routine (aahar and vihar). The six ritus, their properties and the
predominant tastes are briefly summarized in the following table:

Food in Ayurveda

Everything that ranges between nectar and poison or between
palatable and unpalatable or potable and non-potable is edible. Food
can be the source of strength and health if taken properly and
appropriately. It can also be the source of weakness and disease if
taken improperly and inappropriately. The following are the
characteristics of a good food/ diet: it provides satisfaction, power
and strength (to the body) instantly and increases age, glow,
enthusiasm, memory, lustre and digestion”. Since the destruction of
lustre”’ is fatal one should take proper care to maintain and increase
it. Therefore, it is advised to take the following eight factors into
account before consuming food as they are responsible for good and
bad effects on the body (Charak Samhita, Sutra Sthana 28:42)”*: 1.'The
qualitative characteristics of the food (Prakrt) 2. The processing of
food (Karana) 3. The combination (Samyoga) 4. The quantity (Rashi) 5.
The habitat of the person (Desha) 6. The time / seasonal variation/
stage of the disease (Ka/a) 7. The variable digestibility of various
food articles (Upayoga Samstha) and 8. The consumer (Upayokta)
(Charak Samhita, Vimana Sthana 1: 21)”

In Ayurveda the edibles (including the beverages) have been
classified into the following twelve categories” according to their
source and form: cereals, pulses, meat, green vegetables, fruits, green
herbs, alcoholic beverages, water, milk and milk products, sweet


--- Page 33 ---
STAYING HEALTHY: THE AYURVEDIC WAY | 313

products including honey, cooked food items, and adjuvant of foods
(ahara_ yogi varga). Maharshi Kashyap considers food to be a great
medicine (mahabheshaja) (Kashyap Samhita, Khil Sthana 4: 5-6). In
Ayurveda the food (ahara) is one of the ten factors (dasa vidha
pariksha)”® that ate used to determine the state of health of an
individual. Its importance can be understood from the fact that there
are four chapters on food (including beverages) in Charak Samhita
(Sutra Sthana) under the title “Annapana Chatushka’””’ and one chapter
entitled “Matrashiteeya Adhyayd’ in Swastha chatushka of Sutra Sthana.
There are three chapters in Ashtang Hnridaya, Sutra Sthana
[Chapters 5-8 entitled “Drava-Dravya Vinaniya Adhyaya’
(Knowledge of Liquid Substances), “Annaswarupa Vijnanniya
Adhyaya” (Knowledge of Food Substances), ““Annaraksha Adhyaya”
(Protection of Food Substances) and “Matrasitiya Adbyaya’” (Partaking
Proper Quantity of Food)]. These chapters have details on the
descriptions of food and beverage, food classification based on their
taste, therapeutic qualities, food safety and measures for the same,
different incompatibilities of food based on their tastes, processing,
dose, time, place, etc., prescriptions of consumption, food qualities
and intake based on the digestive ability of an individual, and the
nature of food that is being consumed.

Modern science classifies food in terms of its constituents like
catbohydrates, proteins, minerals, vitamins, fats, water and the like.
Food-items ate recommended on the basis of their utility/ deficiency
in a human body. But Ayurveda says that food-items may be
classified in a number of ways.” For example:

On the basis of eatability: edibles/ inedibles.

¢ On the basis of their source: those based on vegetable sources
/ animal sources

© On the basis of their effects on the consumer: a positive effect
(wholesome)/ an unhealthy, unwholesome, or negative effect.

¢ On the basis of the way it is ingested: drinkables, eatables,
chewables, and linctuses.

¢ On the basis of the taste (rasa) — six categories viz. sweet
(madhur), sour (amla), salty (Javana), bitter (#kfa), pungent
(Katz) and astringent (Kashaya).

¢ On the basis of their texture or properties: twenty types viz.


--- Page 34 ---
314 | IMPACT OF PANDEMIC ON SOCIETY, CULTURE AND EDUCATION

heavy, light, cold, hot, unctuous, dry, slow (dull), sharp, stable,
fluidity, soft, hard, clear, viscid, refined, smooth, rough, subtle,
gross, dense (or solid) and liquid.

¢ On the basis of their source, nature and effect: sattvic, rajasic

and s/amasic.

As one should not take unwholesome (Apathya/ harmful) diet.
Mahrishi Charak gives a long list of wholesome (Pathya/ beneficial)
and unwholesome food articles (for details see Charak Samhita, Sutra
Sthana 25: 37-39, 49) which owing to the paucity of space cannot be
reproduced here. Charak Samhita also details the
pharmacological principles (aushadhajnana) of wholesome and
unwholesome diet. Their taste, potency, post-digestive qualities and
specific properties are important for preservation of health and
management of disease. The five principles that enable the
understanding of the mechanism of action of food on a human body
ate: rasa (taste)”, veerya (potency), guna (quality), vipaka (metabolite) and
prabhava (specific effect/ potency). A large number of food-items have
been analysed on the basis of the above bases in the
“Atreyabhadrakapytya Adhyaya” and “Annapanavidhi Adhyaya”
(Charak Samhita, Sutra Sthana, Chapters 26 & 27).

In the Ayurvedic texts there is also a discussion about the adverse
effects of the excessive consumption of a particular rasa. The edibles
act on a human body by their nature or with the help of their
inherent qualities. They fall into three categories - some alleviate
doshas, some vitiate dhatus some ate good for the maintenance of
positive health and the like. Certain food articles and some of their
combinations ate incompatible to the body and lead to disease due
to their antagonistic properties. These are categorized under
viruddha (incompatible or antagonistic) items. This antagonism may
be in terms of properties, combination, processing, place, time, dose
etc. or natural composition’. (Charak Samhita, Sutra Sthana 26: 81)
Here ate some examples of incompatible food-items mentioned in
Charak. Samhita. “One should not take any fish along with milk
particularly chi/chima because it being a great obstructer of channels
produces these disorders with gross symptoms and also excites
amavisha. Meat of domestic, marshy and aquatic animals should not
be taken mixed with honey, sesamum, jaggery, milk, black gram,
radish, lotus stalk or germinated grains because it causes deafness,
blindness, tremors, coldness, indistinct voice, dumbness, nasal voice
ot death. ... Likewise, if one takes rough and cold food in the winter


--- Page 35 ---
STAYING HEALTHY: THE AYURVEDIC WAY | 315

and pungent and hot articles in the summer, it is antagonistic in
terms of time. Honey and ghee taken together in equal quantity is
antagonistic in terms of dose. The use of sweet and cold substances
by a person accustomed to pungent and hot is antagonism in terms
of suitability. ... Antagonistic (viruddha) food is the cause of
impotency, blindness, erysipelas, ascites, pustules, insanity, fistula-in-
ano, fainting, narcosis, tympanitis, spasm in the throat, anaemia, ama
visha, leacoderma, leprosy, grahaniroga, oedema, acid gastritis, fever,
rhinitis, genetic disorders and even death. (Charak Samhita, Sutra
Sthana 26: 81-103)'' Therefore, it is advised that one should not take
food with greed and ignorance but one should consume wholesome
food after evaluation as the body is formed from food. (Charak
Samhita, Sutra Sthana 28: 41)" The processing of a material can
change the potency, safety, and pharmacological effect of the
material. The case of curd/ yogurt has specially been mentioned.
(Charak Samhita, Sutra Sthana 7: 61-62)'° It is considered
unwholesome in most dosha imbalanced conditions. There are specific
instructions to consume yogurt: it should not be taken at night, or in
the seasons such as spring, summer, and fall; and that it should be
taken with sugar candy or green gram soup or honey. For optimal
functioning of the body and mind, one needs to eat primarily Sattvic
foods with just enough Rajas and Tamas gunas to that add vigour and
stability to enable one to stay goal-oriented. An ideal diet must
consist of fresh or freshly prepared grains, legumes, vegetables,
fruits, nuts, milk and ghee besides cold-pressed oils and natural
sweeteners, along with a few, controlled portions of Rayasic and
Tamasic foods. “When nourishment is pure, reflection and higher
understanding are pure; memory becomes strong. When memory
becomes strong, there is release from all the knots of the heart.”
(Chhandogya Upanishad, 7.26.2)"

Ayurveda and Spices

Geography of India has bestowed it with a wonderful bio-diversity
that consists of so many unique plants and trees that yield a large
number of spices. Indian sages have found that there is no plant that
does not have a medicinal value”. A medicine is also a kind of food-
item. While food items are valued for their tastes (rasa) prominently,
medicines are valued for their potency (virya/ guna). The spices ate
those food-items which are valued for both rasa and guna. As most of
the spices are abundantly available in India as a natural resource


--- Page 36 ---
316 | IMPACT OF PANDEMIC ON SOCIETY, CULTURE AND EDUCATION

Indians use them richly and intelligently in their everyday life as a part
of their diet to increase the taste (rasa) of food, to digest the food
being consumed, to keep healthy and to counter various diseases. It
has also been noted that the nature of a food item changes in
certain combinations. For example, the addition of ginger to food
reduces the latter’s heaviness; ginger taken with rock salt reduces the
vata symptoms; ginger with honey reduces kapha symptoms. The
Indian cooks use spices with discretion so that food to be consumed
gives the maximum benefit to a human body. This knowledge based
on Ayurvedic principles'”® is generally transmitted traditionally from
generation to generation. Thus, it shall not be an exaggeration to say
that Indian kitchen is a sort of pharmacology laboratory.

According to the ayurvedic beej-bhoomi theory of disease, poor
digestion is the root cause of the most of the disorders. Proper
digestion is critical for optimal health; everything one eats turns into
either the tissues of the body or toxins called “ama” — and the
determining factor is the strength of one’s agui. When the consumed
food is not digested properly, ama, the by-product of poor digestion
and metabolism, builds up in the body, clogging the micro-channels
of the body. Thus, the efficient flow of nutrients to the different
parts of the body is blocked. Consequently, the immune system is
weakened and the unrestricted flow of wastes out of the body gets
hampered. All this prepares a “fertile breeding ground” for an
infection. Spices help in the proper digestion of the food by
strengthening the fire element (agmi 1.e., digestive fire), increasing pifta
and balancing the three doshas. By following this regimen, a
condition for infection is not created and the person stays
healthy. It has been said that “the disciplined man who practices
wholesome diet lives for a period of 36000 nights (one hundred
years) and is blessed by good people and is free from diseases.”'””
(Charak Samhita, Sutra Sthana 27: 348). The following spices are
commonly found and used in Indian households:

1. Asafetida (e777 heeng): It is used in Indian vegetarian cuisines to
enhance the flavour of numerous dishes. It is considered to be
an appetizer. It decreases vata and kapha and increases pitta. It is
useful in curing flatulence, colics, carminative, respiratory
conditions like asthma, whooping cough and bronchitis.

2. Basil (gerat tu/asi): A basil plant is a must in every Hindu
household for its spiritual and medicinal importance. It


--- Page 37 ---
STAYING HEALTHY: THE AYURVEDIC WAY | 317

balances Vata and Kapha as well as Pitta when used in lesser
quantities. It is a warming herb and contributes the sweet, bitter
and pungent tastes. It is valued for its anti-bacterial
properties, anti-inflammatory effects and antioxidants that
protect the heart. It creates purity and lightness in the body
while clearing out body-toxins. Basil leaves are generally used in
preparing tea or chutney.

. Bay Leaves (9 Ta #7 patta): The bay leaf can be used as whole
ot ground. It is an aromatic leaf which is used to flavour
Indian curries, rice dishes, custards and soups. Dried and
ground, Indian Bay leaves are added to spice mix, Garam
Masala. They are warming and pacify Kapha and Vata doshas but
increase P7tta. In Ayurveda, bay leaves are used in teas to help
soothe respiratory problems and indigestion. It is antt-
spasmodic, immunostimulant, antioxidant, anti-diabetic and anti-
inflammatory. It provides strength to the uterine musculature
and supports the pregnancy.

. Bishop’s Weed (Sar ajwain): Ajwain seeds are used with
vegetables like lady finger (Okra), taro root (arbi) and others in
Indian kitchens. It corrects the flow of vata and alleviates
kapha. As it is a mild laxative that kills parasites, awakens
digestion and alleviates intestinal spasms, it is used as a
carminative medicine. Ajwain water, distilled from the seeds, is
a cure for flatulence, indigestion and low appetite.

. Black Pepper (#reft fr kali mirch): Pepper could be green, white
ot black in colour, all of which have a very strong flavour. Of
these, black pepper is a common spice used in Indian cooking
either as whole or crushed. It is excellent for pacifying Kapha,
helps pacify Vata and increases Pitta. Pepper provides relief in
cold, cough and respiratory disorders besides providing relief
from indigestion and constipation. Black pepper oil in food
removes toxins from our body, cures a toothache, an earache,
an insect-bite and helps in skin problems. Apart from these,
pepper also prevents clothes from fading.

. Cardamom (scret slayachi): Indian households use two
varieties of cardamom viz. black cardamom (¢/ayachi) and


--- Page 38 ---
318 | IMPACT OF PANDEMIC ON SOCIETY, CULTURE AND EDUCATION

green cardamom (Ezdaria) for their unique aroma and flavour
in different dishes, particularly milk and milk products. It is
used to balance kapha and pitta dosha. It boosts digestion and
fights gastric troubles, constipation and dysentery but reduces
symptoms of asthma. Green cardamom is also very useful for
treating sleep troubles. It helps in reducing foul mouth smell,
lowering blood pressure, improving breathing and
potentially helps stomach ulcers heal.

7. Red/Green Chillies (ere / ett lal / hari mirch): An Indian meal is
incomplete without chillies in some form. While green chillies
are a part of salad dry red chilli powder is an essential addition
in many finger licking cuisines including chat. Chilli pickles,
chutney and sauces are also quite popular. In its characteristics
like pungency, taste and flavour it matches black pepper. It
reduces vitiated Kapha and Vara and increases Pitta. It improves
digestion and develops blood; it is a very rich source of vitamin
C, which helps in developing the immune system.

8. Cinnamon (eet dalhini): Cinnamon /Cassia bark is a strong
aromatic, sweet, pleasant and warm astringent. Cinnamon
sticks are added to whole cloves and green cardamom pods,
when sauteing onions and ginger etc. in oil. They are also a key
ingredient in garam masala and masala chai. It has warming
properties and pacifies Kapha and balances Vata. It has anti-
inflammatory properties and is said to be a mood lifter. It is
used for treating rheumatism and other inflammations. It is
also useful as a food preservative to inhibit the growth of
common food-borne bacteria such as Salmonella and E
coli.

9. Clove (e#1 /aung): Cloves, whole or ground, are used in a
number of traditional Indian dishes notably, sauces, soups and
rice dishes. In spite of its intense flavour and aroma clove is
said to be cooling by the ancient texts. Because of this special
effect that clove possesses, it is considered balancing for all
three doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha), although it increases Pitta
(heat) when taken in excess. Clove powder and oil are very
effective in treating fever, problems related to the head,
nausea, ypertension, disorders of the nose, sore gums,


--- Page 39 ---
STAYING HEALTHY: THE AYURVEDIC WAY | 319

toothache, improving digestion and strengthening the immune
system.

10.Coriander (afar dhaniya): Coriander is used both as a herb and a
spice. It has an aromatic scent with undertones of citrus. The
leaves are generally used to make chutney and to give an aroma
to the curries. It balances all the three doshas. Coriander seeds
are a good household remedy for many Péa disorders,
particularly those of the digestive tract or urinary system.
Regular use of coriander in one’s diet lowers bad cholesterol,
increases good cholesterol, promotes a healthy digestive
system, and helps prevent eye problems.

11.Cumin (sf jeera): Cumin is commonly used to add flavour to
meals in various ways and forms. It is used with most of the
cutries, butter milk and fruits. Roasted cumin is an essential
ingredient of savoury chat. It pacifies Kapha Dosha and Vata
Dosha and increases Pitta Dosha. It 1s also reduces Sama Pitta
condition (Pitta detoxifier). It improves taste, aids in digestion,
boosts the immune system, treats skin disorders, fights cancer
and treats respiratory problems.

12.Curry Leaf @# Ta kari patta): Curry leaves (also called sweet
neem leaves) ate vibrant green, teardrop-shaped glossy leaves
that have a lemon scent and a distinct, pungent taste. Whole
sprigs of fresh curry leaves are often fried in ghee or cooking
medium with other spices and then stirred into any curry.
Curry leaves have mild laxative properties that not only help
the stomach eliminate waste from the system, but also clears
the body of ‘Ama (toxic waste) and balances the pitta levels in
the body. Curry leaves help in increasing good cholesterol,
treating diabetes, relieving indigestion, and fighting against
ulcers. They are viewed as anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic,
and anti-microbial.

13.Fennel (a saunj): In size and shape fennel seeds resemble
cumin but are different in colour. Most of the Indians have a
few fennel seeds at the end of every meal to beat bad breath
and freshen up their mouths. The seeds have a cooling effect
on the body. They are one of the best herbs for digestion as
they strengthen agai without ageravating pitta; they check

320

IMPACT OF PANDEMIC ON SOCIETY, CULTURE AND EDUCATION

cramping and dispel flatulence. They are also a concentrated
source of minerals like Calcium, Copper, Iron, Magnesium,
Manganese, Potassium, Selentum, and Zinc and Vitamin C.

14.Fenugreek (42 meth): Indians use fenugreek leaves as curry and

seeds as spice. They give the dishes a sweet yet slightly bitter
taste. It increases vata and pitta and reduces kapha. Some of the
health benefits of this herb/spice include healing mouth
ulcers, eliminating dandruff, healing stomach disorders,
relieving sore throats, easing menstrual discomfort, and
increasing milk production in breast- feeding mothers.

15.Garam Masala (IRA Fare): Garam masala is a blend of ground

spices like bay leaf, black and green cardamom pods, black and
white peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, cumin, fennel
and mace. The flavours may be carefully blended to achieve a
balanced effect. It is generally used in Indian curries. Its
function is to keep the digestive agai working to its optimum so
that increased metabolism is in place. Its use lowers blood-
sugar levels, reduces bloating and aids in detoxification and
fights bad breath. It increases one’s ability to absorb vitamins,
minerals, and proteins.

16.Ginger (He adarak): Ginger stimulates digestion and recovers

appetite. Indians use both fresh and dry ginger (saunth) very
frequently in their cooking and beverages. In Ayurvedic
terms it decreases vata and kapha and increases pitta. It is
commonly used in gastro-intestinal disorders like vomiting,
nausea, indigestion and respiratory conditions like cold,
cough, asthma and congestion.

17.Mace (sifeat Javitri): Mace, the outer covering of nutmeg, is

more delicate in flavour than nutmeg; it tastes like a
combination of pepper and cinnamon. It is added to the
desserts for the flavour and is used in small quantities in garam
masala. It is tich in minerals like calcium, magnesium,
phosphorus, manganese, zinc, copper and iron and in several
vitamins like Vitamin A, C, B1 and B2. It is hot in constitution
and balances vata and kapha doshas. It removes mucus,
improves skin tone, complexion, taste and appetite and is tonic


--- Page 41 ---
STAYING HEALTHY: THE AYURVEDIC WAY | 321

for heart. It is also anti- bacterial, anti-viral, anti-cancer, anti-
inflammatory, anti- diabetes and heptoprotective.

18.Mint (gé7 pudina): The mint leaves, fresh or dried, are used by
Indians largely in preparing various beverages and chutney. The
leaves have a watm, fresh, aromatic, sweet flavour with a cool
after-taste. Mint has the quality to pacify all the three doshas and
chiefly manages the Pitta dosha. It aids in weight loss, digestion
and skin care, treats asthma and common cold, cures headache,
improves brain power, masks bad breath, eases symptoms of
morning sickness or nausea and beats stress and depression.

19.Mustard (aa sarason): In Indian households mustard seeds are
used as a spice to flavour curries and pickles. Green mustard
leaves are used to prepare curry. Mustard oil is used for
frying various edibles and cuisines. It decreases vata and pitta
and increases kapha. It is known for its high anti-inflammatory
effects. The high source of magnesium in mustard seeds helps
reducing the severity of asthma attacks and certain symptoms
of rheumatoid arthritis, reducing weight, controls cholesterol
and diabetes and lowering blood pressure.

20.Nutmeg (aed jayaphal): Nutty and slightly sweet, nutmeg is
an intense spice that has a strong and distinct aroma. It is an
ingredient in the spice blend, garam masala. In Indian cuisine,
nutmeg is used in many sweet as well as savoury dishes,
predominantly in Mughlai cuisine. It contains powerful anti-
inflammatory plant compounds that act as antioxidants. It is a
kapha and vata dosha suppressant. It is valued for its ability to
relieve pain, soothe indigestion, detoxify the body, boost skin
health, reduce insomnia, increase immune system function and
improve blood circulation.

21.Saffron (4a Kesar): It is one the costliest spices in the World and
hence it is used only on special occasions in the Indian
households. It smells a bit like sweet hay and contributes a
luminous yellow-orange colouring to foods. It balances the
Vata, Pitta and Kaphadoshas in our body. It has anti-carcinogenic,
anti-mutagenic, immunomodulating, and  antioxidant-like
properties. It increases appetite but reduces indigestion,
diarrhoea, vomiting and acidity. It is also considered to be a


--- Page 42 ---
322 | IMPACT OF PANDEMIC ON SOCIETY, CULTURE AND EDUCATION

cardiac tonic.

22.Turmeric (@ea ha/di): Turmeric powder is a very common spice in
Indian households. It imparts a golden yellow colour, earthy
aroma and pungent and slightly bitter flavour to foods. It is
used mostly in savoury and sweet dishes. It is another popular
Ayurvedic remedy. It is valued for its anti- oxidant, anti-
tumoural, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, anti-hepatotoxic,
anti-hyperlipidaemia, and insect repellent effects. It is widely
used to heal wounds and cuts. It is also used in anemia,
inflammatory conditions and skin diseases.

The spices because of their wide uses, appeal and acceptance
have attracted the attention of the world towards India and the Far
East. In fact, the European desire to have an easy access to the
Indian spices led to the discovery of a new sea route rounding Africa
from Western Europe to India in 1498. It changed the face of the
world for ever. It left an indelible impact on the world; it resulted in
the proclamation of the King Manuel of Portugal as the ‘Lord of the
Navigation, Conquest and Commerce of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia
and India’ and he soon became “the wealthiest ruler of Europe”
(Saraiva, 334) and earned for himself the sobriquet of “the Spice
King.” The import of this appellation can be gauged from the
following remark of George Birdwood that amplifies the power
relation between spices and the rulers: “...the history of modern
Europe, and emphatically of England, is the history of the quest of
the aromatic gum resins and balsams, and condiments and spices, of
India, Further India, and the Indian Archipelago” (Birdwood, 101)

Of late so many researches’ debunking the time-tested claims

about the good effects of the spices have appeared. It could be a fall
out of the rivalry the Modern medical system, backed by the
powerful lobby of the multi-billionaire modern Pharma industry, has
with Indian traditional systems (spices included) because of their
value in terms of healthy solutions, number of the followers, huge
Indian population and money. However, the undeterred Indians
continue with their habits and keep on maintaining their health using
the natural gifts. Even during the Corona-2019/20 crisis Indians have
emerged victorious without much monetary investment as compared
to other countries. This may be attributed to the natural
immunisation of Indians through Indian kitchen pharmacopeia
though currently there is no authentic study to (dis)prove this claim.

Ayurveda and Epidemics

In Ayurveda the term janapadodhvansa is a generic term for natural and
man-made calamities. There is a full chapter devoted to this issue
under the title “Janapadodhvansaniya Vimana” in Charak Samhita (Vimana
Sthana, Chapter 3). It deals with the causes of the environmental
calamities (goes beyond epidemics), leading to annihilation of
communities along with their remedial measures. An epidemic affects
all those individuals who irrespective of their individualistic
characteristics in constitution (humour and skeleton), dietary habits,
physical strength, vitality, habits, psychic make up and age are not
able to sustain the stress caused by the environmental factors and
therefore are affected by this phenomenon. In Ashtangsangraha, the
concept of janapadodhvansa has been described under the chapter
entitled Viruddhanna Viynaniyam (Ashtangsangraha, Sutra Sthana chapter
9). Sushruta refers to the concept of janapadodhvansa while discussing
seasonal regimen (rtucharya) under the title “Maraka?’ (Sushruta
Smahita, Sutra Sthana 6:17). He uses different terms for them like,
Alagantuj (exogenous disease), Kalbalpravrutta (ecological disease),
Adhidawik (Natural/ Seasonal) and Aadhibhotik (caused by
environmental stresses). These diseases may be

1. due to abnormal and normal season (Kalakrut-Vyapann
rutuknit and Avyapann rutukrit)

2. caused by supernatural agencies like lightning and thunder and
by evil spirits (Daivavalapravrut-Vidyut-asanikrut and Pisachakrut)

3. infectious and idiopathic and functional - timely and untimely
(Samsargaj and Akasmik, Swabhavavalakrut-Kalakrut and Akalkrut)

According to Mahrishi Charak contamination in any one or more
of the following four environmental factors in progressive order on
the basis of their indispensability - air (vayv), water (udaka), land
(desha), and season (ala) - results in an outbreak of an epidemic.
Charak writes that it is easier to correct the vitiation of vayu, udaka
and desha, than of udaka, desha and kala. (Charak Samhita, Vimana
Sthana 3: 10-11)" Charak tells the following causes of the vitiation of
the above factors: the sinful acts (Adbarma) committed during an
individual’s present life and the past lives, intellectual errors
(prajnaparadha), non-performing or shirking from one’s religious duties
and the curses by the elders, the wise, the nobility, the sages and the
preceptors. Large scale deaths also come from violence perpetrated


--- Page 44 ---
324 | IMPACT OF PANDEMIC ON SOCIETY, CULTURE AND EDUCATION

attacks on or by the enemies; the root causes of this sort of violence
are excessive greed (/obha), anger (krodha), attachment (moba), and
disregarding the weak.

Charak further says that the life span of all living beings depends
on the proper coordination of two factors, namely, daiva (divine/pre-
determined) and purushakara (human effort). Daiva means one’s own
deeds in the previous life while purushakara stands for one’s actions in
this life. Therefore, the one who follows a wholesome regimen and
who has collected and processed proper medicaments (before the
calamities) is likely to survive the hard times. Besides, Charak
suggests the following dos and don'ts:

Dos: Truthfulness, compassion for living beings, charity,
sacrifices, worshipping God, observance of right conduct, tranquility,
prophylactic protection of oneself and seeking one’s own good,
residing in a wholesome country, practicing celibacy (brahmacharya),
rendering service to the celibates, discussing religious scriptures,
constantly associating with the righteous, the well-disposed and with
those who ate approved of by the elders - all this with a view to
protecting life has been termed ‘medicine’ to those who are not
destined to die in that critical time. (Charak Samhita, Vimana Sthana 3:
12-18)"

“One should abstain from excessive, negative and perverted use
of time, actions, and senses. It is important to control emotions, not
suppress the natural urges (to pass bodily wastes), and avoid over-
exertion. One should resort to the right and gradual habituation (and
not a rapid or quick adoption) to behaviour and dietetic articles
which are antagonistic to the prevailing region, season and one’s
own constitution.” One should suppress the urges that need to be
controlled (Charak Samhita, Vimana Sthana 3: 36, 38)'"'

Don’ts: “One should not have excessive (of one’s own digestive
power or agni) and irregular meals, an irregular posture of the body,
an excessive indulgence in sex and an evil or wicked company; one
should not suppress the manifested natural urges and should not
avoid proper treatment and medicines if afflicted with an injury, a
poison, wind and fire, a disease or with evil spirits (germs)” (Charak
Samhita, Vimana Sthana 3: 37-38)'

The therapeutic modalities are incorporated in the disease
prevention protocol in Ashtang Hridayam. (Ashtang Hridayam, Sutra
Sthana, chapter 4) Maharishi Charak suggests that in order to meet the


--- Page 45 ---
STAYING HEALTHY: THE AYURVEDIC WAY | 325

exigency of epidemics herbs possessing good quality of taste (rasa),
potency (veerya), metabolism of diet and drugs (vjpaka) and specific
attribute (prabhava) should be collected well in advance, before the
signs of the epidemic start appearing. The principle of treatment
according to Charak should be the administration of antagonistic
therapies to their causes (vitiated doshas). (Charak Sambita, Vimana
Sthana 3: 36, 41-42)' Besides he has suggested three kinds of
depletion (Apatarpana) [(viz., reducing therapy (/amghana), reducing
therapy along with therapies for digestion of ama dosha (lamghana
pachana) and elimination of vitiated doshas from the body
(doshavasechana)| (Charak Sambita, Vimana Sthana 3: 43)''\* and five
kinds of elimination therapies (viz., emesis, purgation, enema- niruha
and anuvasana types and errhines) followed by rejuvenation treatment
(rasayana chikitsa) with medicinal herbs collected before the onset of
epidemics as a remedy. (Charak Samhita, Vimana Sthana 3: 13-14)'”

Ayurveda and Covid-19

Ayurveda is a way of life. So, when one reads the Gwidelines for
Ayurveda Practitioners for Covid-19 (https://www.ayush.gov.in/docs/
ayurved-geuidlines.pdf) one hardly comes across any new and special
outline that has not been discussed above as the general principle of
health. In Ayurveda, healthy drinks/foods, called  Svastha-hita-
dravyas''®, are indicated in the form of Rasayana and Vajikarana. Ojas is
considered to be responsible for immunity (Vyadhikshamatva). It is
achieved by two approaches viz., Vyadhi Bala Virodhitva and
Vyadhyutpadaka Pratibandhakatva. Among them
Vyadhibalavirodhitva is achieved by improving the immunity of an
individual’s body, while Vyadhyutpadaka Pratibandhakatva is created by
using specific recipes for the prevention of a disease. AYUSH
protocol classifies the patients into two groups and accordingly some
medicines have been suggested:

© 1st stage — Swasa-Kasa symptoms with Fever (Jwara) (COVID-19
positive or negative with mild symptoms)
© 2nd stage — Vata-Kapha pradhan Jwara (Fever) (COVID-19
positive with specific symptoms at moderate level)
The following twelve guidelines that are in sync with the WHO
protocol have been issued by the Ministry of AYUSH:

1. Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19

. Maintain Hygiene
. Keep Social Distancing

. Take additional care of elderly persons and children

. COVID-19 positive women can breastfeed if they wish to do
so.

6. DIET: Proper nutrition is to be ensured through freshly
cooked hot food considering individual’s digestive power.
Intake of comfortable warm fluids boiled with medicinal herbs
(preferably Shanthi, Dalchini, Trikatu) should be used as a regular
drink to maintain hydration. Freshly prepared easily digestible,
light diet (Laghu-supachyaahara) should be taken.

7. Cope up with stress as it is normal to feel stressed, scared or
angry during the lockdown period.

8. Practice Yogasanas and Pranayama daily for at least 30
minutes.

9. Adequate sleep of 7-8 hours at night is essential and should be
encouraged.

10. Avoid self-medication if any comorbidities exist; prescribed
medicines ate to be encouraged to be taken under
supervision.

11.Seasonal regimen (Rétucharya) under the consultation /
supervision of Ayurveda Physician should be encouraged.

12.Usage of adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
during medical practice as advised by health care authorities is
to be encouraged.

Accordingly, some single drugs and formulations have been
suggested for enhancing immunity. Besides, some Lifestyle Tips
(Dinacharya) for boosting immunity have been suggested. However,
efforts to debunk this life style including Ayurveda continue
particularly in the western media in the name of scientific thinking.

Ayurveda and the Principles of Health Promotion

“Health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase
control over, and to improve their health.’ (Health Promotion

STAYING HEALTHY: THE AYURVEDIC WAY | 327

Glossary, 1998) Health promotion is comparatively a new idea in the
West as it was initiated with the first International Conference on
Health Promotion in Ottawa in 1986. The basic strategies for health
promotion identified in the Ottawa Charter were: advocate (to
boost the factors which encourage health), enable (allowing all
people to achieve health equity) and mediate (through collaboration
across all sectors). This is an integral approach that has traditionally
been adopted by Indian society and the Ayurvedic system. Ayurveda
fits into all the principles of Health Promotion proposed by WHO
(https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a- detail /what-is-health-
promotion#):

1. Ayurveda involves the population as a whole in the context of
their everyday life, besides focusing on people at risk for
specific diseases. It enables people to take control over, and
responsibility for, their health as an important component of
everyday life — both as spontaneous and organized action
for health.

2. Ayurveda is directed towards action on the determinants or
causes of health. Ayurveda works with a dose of cooperation
of sectors beyond health services, reflecting the diversity of
conditions which influence health. A government has least
responsibility but tries to ensure a ‘total’ environment
conducive to health, which is beyond the control of
individuals and groups.

3. Ayurveda combines diverse but complementary methods and
approaches, including communication, education, — self-
regulation, environmental and economic concerns, local
resources, community support and spontaneous local activities
against health hazards.

4. Ayurveda seeks an effective and concrete public participation
by moulding behaviour on a dharmic model. This works on the
principle of problem-defining and decision-making life-skills
both individually and collectively.

5. Ayurveda is not only a medical service but it is an activity that
combines health, environment and dharmic way of life in
individual and social fields. The government should encourage
it to bring stress (in fields like self-reliance, costly medication,

law and order, physical, mental, social and spiritual health)
under control.

Conclusion

The life-style of Indians revolves round the notion that they are not
immortal beings as they are fed on the wisdom of the following lines
of the Bhagavadgita (2:27)'"’ since childhood: “Death is certain for one
who has been born, and rebirth is inevitable for one who has died.
Therefore, one should not lament over the inevitable.” In this light it
is noticeable that most of the tips given above are mainly concerned
with keeping one healthy and fit and preventing premature aging by
boosting immunity and improving digestion. The effort is directed at
providing essential nutrients to our body without much expenditure.
If one includes Yoga and Pranayam to one’s daily routine one can stay
healthy very easily without seeing a doctor. Consequently, it brings
down expenses on medicines/ doctors quite considerably. “He who is
temperate in his habits of eating, sleeping, working and recreation
can mitigate all material pains by practicing the yoga system.”
(Bhagavadgita, 6: 17) In fact the rules to keep a body healthy are so
simple that even an animal knows/practices them. Most of the things
to maintain one’s good health are available abundantly and almost
free of cost. This approach of keeping healthy is good for an
individual and a society but bad for those who calculate the health of
economy in terms of GDP and measure human index in terms of
expenditure incurred on medicines. They value a surge in the sale of
the pharmaceutical products more as it implies a boost in the Pharma
sector of the share market. In the economic terms this shows a
growth of the economy which has a direct impact on increasing the
GDP. The Western economists consider it to be a good sign for
booming economy; the modern Indians just ditto the opinion of
their former colonial masters. For them, the increasing sale of
medicines indicates that people ate paying more attention to their
health and increasing their work-capacity. To a traditional Indian it
is quite a deplorable situation as it means more and more people are
falling ill. There are some who cannot live without increasing GDP
but there are also some others who say an individual’s or a society’s
health is more important than the growth in GDP for the increased
growth of GDP is not the indicator of people’s good health or their
happiness.

In the light of the above discussion, one may safely conclude that

Ayurveda is a time-tested knowledge of health-care and may be
adopted by all people without any sort of regimentation. The people
of the world and the UNO, therefore, must start paying due attention
and due respect to the traditional wisdom and should move forward
with a scientific temperament shedding their biases, adopting
whatever is good and discarding whatever is rotten, irrespective of
the geographical location and origination. Let me end the entire
discussion above with some of the wishes that Hindus make after
their prayers:

1. May peace radiate there in the whole sky as well as in the vast

ethereal space everywhere! / May peace reign all over this
earth, in water and in all herbs, trees and creepers! / May peace
flow over the whole universe! /May peace be in the Supreme
Being Brahman! /And may there always exist in all peace and
peace alone! /Aum peace, peace and peace to us and all
beings! '"*

. May the well-being of all people be protected by the powerful

and mighty leaders with law and justice! /May the success be
with all divinity and scholars, May all the worlds become

. Om, May all be happy! / May all be free from illness! / May all

see what is auspicious! / May no one suffer! / Om peace,
peace, peace!'””

. May there be well-being in all! / May there be peace in all! /

May there be fulfilment in all! / May there be auspiciousness in
all! /Om peace! peace! peace!
